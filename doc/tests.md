# JSON API Test Cases

This is the list of cases that a consumer of the JSONAPI.org spec must
implement to be in compliance.

## Test Cases

### 1 - Finding Records by ID
#### 1.1 - Finding a Record by Numeric ID
#### 1.2 - Finding a Record by String ID

## Open Questions

* How do the tests the notion of type? Do they provide a normalize
  type string, like `"post"`? If so, how do we normalize types? This is
  not currently in the spec.
